          <div class="Terraria">
            <div> <img class="TerrariaImg" src="Images/Terraria.jpg" alt="Terraria" /> </div>

            <div class="TerrariaText"> I love Terraria. Terraria is my absolute favorite game no questions asked. I grew up with it and the content in the game is absolutely beautiful. The bosses, items, events, etc. are all so fun. The game progression is absolutely amazing and so, so, so much more. </div>
        </div>

          <div class="HK">
            <div> <img class="HKImg" src="Images/Hollow Knight.jpg" alt="HK" /> </div>

            <div class="HKText"> I love Hollow Knight. This games shines in its bosses. The art design of all the bugs are absolutely perfect. They are very well designed. The music and the story of the game as mindblowing. You could listen to the same soundtrack of Hollow Knight for the rest of your life and love it every time. The story is almost perfectly shown in the game and, if looked into deeply, will reveal very nice details about the game. </div>
        </div>

            <div class="Valheim">
           <div> <img class="ValheimImg" src="Images/Valheim.jpg" alt="Valheim" /> </div>

            <div class="ValheimText"> I love Valheim. Valheim is my 3rd most favorite game and it isn't even fully out yet it is that good. I love the art style. The enemies are sick and the progression is also very nice. I love the Viking theme to it especially the ships that you can make. Adding onto the ships, they are very fun to sail and make you feel like a true Viking. Yet again the music is mesmerizing and calm. Just overall a very fun game.
